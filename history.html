                        <p>The General Post Office was built on O’Connell Street in 1814 by architect Francis Johnston It took 3 years to complete, 
                            and the result seems to have lived up to the architect’s expectations. The building is very imposing, with its neo-classical columns 
                            and pediment, and was built in the Georgian style so dear to the city. In 1817, the building was declared complete, 
                            and the Irish Post Office was able to leave its former premises on Dame Street and move to Dublin’s main thoroughfare: O’Connell Street.</p>
