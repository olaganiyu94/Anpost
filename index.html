                        <hr>
                        <p>The General Post Office was built on O’Connell Street in 1814 by architect
                            Francis Johnston,It took 3 years to complete, and the result seems to have lived up to the architect’s expectations.
                            The building is very imposing, with its neo-classical columns and pediment,
                            and was built in the Georgian style so dear to the city.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>1916: at this time, Dublin’s Central Post Office is one of the city’s nerve
                            centers,
                            and has been delivering mail for many, many years.
                            At the time, Ireland and Dublin were living in an extremely tense political context,
                            with the Irish and British struggling to co-exist on the same territory.
                            Faced with this situation, which has lasted for centuries,
                            the Irish government and the Irish Republican Brotherhood decided to launch a gigantic revolt,
                            scheduled for Easter.
                            A strategic plan was devised to seize the city’s main buildings.
                            Dublin’s Central Post Office was naturally part of this, and it was on April 24,
                            1916 that the Irish Volunteer Force and the Irish Citizen Army took control of the Central Post Office.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>the GPO served as the headquarters of the uprising's leaders.
                            It was from outside this building on 24 April 1916,
                            that Patrick Pearse read out the Proclamation of the Irish Republic.
                            The building was destroyed by fire in the course of the rebellion,
                            save for the granite facade, and not rebuilt until 1929, by the Irish Free State government.
                            An original copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic was displayed in the museum at the GPO.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Easter Rising was put down a few days later by the British,
                            and the Irish were defeated…
                            During this revolt, the Central Post Office was somewhat damaged.
                            It was not restored until a few years later, when the Irish Free State was officially created.
                            To commemorate this event, a statue of Cúchulainn,
                            a major hero of the town, was erected in front of the Central Post Office (it remains there to this
                            day).</p>
